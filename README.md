# DailyArchiveLogs-Batch
The Archive Logs Daily Batch script was created work with Task Scheduler to archive a certain directory log files on a regular basis.  This script however is just for log files, it is is pretty much anything in that directory that you set the target for, it just so happens that the directory we targeted was nothing but logs.    The script will create a directory based on the current day in the Target \Archive Folder ( this archive folder is created if it doesnâ€™t exist ), then it will look at all the files in the target and zip everything older then 2 days into the cab file, then it will take that cab file and move it to the archive directory.  After the Cab file has been moved, it will then delete all the log files older then 2 days.  This script was mostly ran via Windows Task Scheduler, on a daily basis.
